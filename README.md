# Automating File Organization with Python

This code is a script that organizes the files in a user's "Downloads" folder. It does this by creating several subfolders in the "Downloads" folder, each one corresponding to a particular file type (e.g., "PDF", "Spreadsheet", etc.). It then iterates through all of the files in the "Downloads" folder, and based on the file extension, moves each file into the appropriate subfolder. For example, if the file ends with ".pdf", it is moved into the "PDF" folder, while a file ending in ".xlsx" is moved into the "Spreadsheet" folder. Any files that don't fit into one of the predefined categories are moved into a catch-all "Misc." folder.

This code can be useful for keeping a user's "Downloads" folder organized and tidy, and for making it easier to find specific types of files. It makes use of several standard Python libraries, including os, shutil, and pathlib, to interact with the filesystem and move files around.
